## Important Note

_This script doesn't works on Windows because of the .strftime("%s") function. Didn't thought about a fix yet._
_This fork is (currently) only fixing the mixup with the payload properties values of expired (exp) and issuedAt (iat) and replace the old function "raw_input()" with "input()"_

# appleMusicTokenGen

To use the Apple Music API, you must have a signed JWT in your request header

According to [Apple's docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi/getting_keys_and_creating_tokens),

> To make requests to the Apple Music API, [Create a MusicKit identifier and private key](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/devce5522674) using a developer token to authenticate yourself as a trusted developer and member of the Apple Developer Program. A signed developer token is required in the header of every Apple Music API request.

## What you'll need

-   A machine with Python 2.7+ and root access
-   A 10-character key identifier [configured for use with the MusicKit Service](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/dev646934554)
-   A 10-character Apple Developer Program Team ID
-   A MusicKit Private Key in a \*.p8 file

### Required Python packages

For the Python script to execute, you'll need to have `pyjwt` and `cryptography` installed. You can get these packages with

```
sudo pip install pyjwt
```

and

```
sudo pip install cryptography
```

## Generating your JWT

### Step 1: Move your \*.p8 private key to the current working directory

For example, if you are running the script from ~/Downloads/appleMusicTokenGen, then you should move the \*.p8 file there.

### Step 2: Run the script and follow directions

```
python appleMusicTokenGen.py
```

The script will prompt you to enter your key identifier and Team ID.

### Step 3: Check the validity of your token

If all goes well, the script will output a curl command that you can run on your terminal. If your token is valid, the request will fetch some Maroon 5 albums!

The response should look like:

```
